# weatherApp
## This app shows my extensive skills using an API to fetch data and show it on the screen depending on the search field criteria. 

### How the app works? 
* The app uses a function component with state variables to store city name and temperature values
* I created a function to act upon the search button being pressed where the function runs the API and substitutes the city criteria with the city entered in the search field
* After receiving the value from the search field the function populates state variables with the data retrieved from the API regarding this specific city
* City and temperature details are then displayed on the app in the modal format
* Implemented "clear" button to de-populate state variables therefore emptying out the space on the screen

### What I can add to the app?
- to make this project more challenging i can transform this app into multi pages app with history tab which should store city and temperature details that were previously looked up
